It is Dr. Downs\u2019 goal to promote the sustainability of Mexican malaria control using Mexican money; and to avoid dependency on foreign funds. Dr. Downs emphasizes the importance of local support for malaria; continued attendance at training sessions instituted to educate Mexicans in the public health field; and the gradual accession of malaria programs by the state. He also comments upon the challenges that face effective public health campaigns given the limitations of the Mexican government. Scientific investigation at the experimental houses at Acatlipa continues. Research focuses on DDT analysis and, in particular, on the retention of DDT residue on adobe bricks. As for the insectary, there, Dr. Downs continues his work maintaining the mosquito colonies and carrying our experimental testing on different mosquito habits, mosquito species, and species of the malaria parasite. His field trips throughout Mexico lead to conclusions on the progress and/or success of state-wide malaria programs and also lead to conclusions on the prevalence of malaria in regions where children are examined for infection.\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "ee514e24139b2b7708fc280515e17472", "publish": true, "label": "Scope and Contents note", "type": "scopecontent"}, {"content": ["193 pages"], "persistent_id": "0ae483d12661e81fb93ca1b44a484a80", "type": "physdesc", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_singlepart"}], "uri": "/repositories/2/archival_objects/361938", "last_modified_by": "admin", "restrictions_apply": false, "position": 5}
