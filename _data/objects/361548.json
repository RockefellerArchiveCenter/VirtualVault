Beard is heavily involved in advising RF nursing fellows-both American and foreign. She discusses their educational development and experiences throughout the entries. Beard continues to develop, reorganize and establish nursing education programs at various institutions around the country such as Vanderbilt University, Russell Sage, John Hopkins and Skidmore College. Beard also details the limitations and setbacks of developing public health nursing education programs at the advanced level. The diary describes the hardships of rural Southern nurses and how the Tennessee Valley Authority Health Study makes an impact on the region.
