Dr. Downs visits the control houses at Acatlipa frequently to conduct such research. At the insectary, investigation focuses on the susceptibility of different anopheline species to contract varying strains of malaria. Both biological (e.g. mosquito age, breeding patterns) and environmental factors (e.g. temperature) are analyzed by Dr. Downs and his team to substantiate any correlation. Diary entries also recount the development and progress of anti-malaria programs by summarizing the status of training centers, scientific investigations, and malaria prevention throughout the country. Frequent field trips to towns and states outside of Mexico continue, and while on such visits Dr.Downs administers anti-malaria drugs and recommends an appropriate method of malaria prevention. Extensive data and observations on the state of malaria in Guerrero are included in this period. Office work mostly involves the logistics of transferring Dr.Down\u2019s office and personnel to a new Malaria Investigation Office, headed by the state; RF funding of the office terminates at the end of 1951.\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "49681b9b8035c1d849c753213876fe50", "publish": true, "label": "Scope and Contents note", "type": "scopecontent"}, {"content": ["182 pages"], "persistent_id": "905139dd7d9bc5ac375e4836c8f660f3", "type": "physdesc", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_singlepart"}], "uri": "/repositories/2/archival_objects/361940", "last_modified_by": "admin", "restrictions_apply": false, "position": 7}
